# ChaseNorth E-Commerce Website
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>

## Why?
I wanted to start with an online store and since I was doing this course and
didn't wanted to use Shopify, I thought I'd make my own.

## What?
I created a website from an [tutorial video](https://invidious.nerdvpn.de/watch?v=hpgh2BTtac8) and
changed/added components which I got also from the internet, modified or build my own.

## How?
I used MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, Redux Toolkit and Supabase to create the website.

## Future Plans?
I plan to add more features to the website:

- Chat Bot
- Automatic Email at Order with invoice

## Functions
cd frontend > npm run dev <br>
cd backend > npm run dev
